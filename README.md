Welcome to the Automator Plus tutorials GitHub repository. Here you'll find all code resources associated with the tutorial videos released on our YouTube channel.

Currently, we have tutorials for creating Adobe Premiere Pro automations on Windows using <a href='https://www.autohotkey.com/'>AutoHotkey</a> as well as using the <a href='https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources'>Adobe Common Extensibility Platform (CEP)</a> API any either Windows or Mac and interact with and create extensions for Premiere Pro. Although the methods we discuss are applicable for any Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

## AutoHotkey
AutoHotkey is an easy to use, free, open-source scripting language for Microsoft Windows. With it you can create shortcuts to virtually anything and you are able to create powerful macros to automate tedious tasks. Here are a few examples:

+ Mapping your internet browser to a specific shortcut.
+ Using shortcuts to fill in frequently used phrases.
+ Combining various shortcuts together inside your favourite program. For example, inside of Premiere Pro, you can combine the 'select clip at playhead' shortcut with the 'ripple delete shortcut'. 

You can download the AutoHotkey program <a href='https://www.autohotkey.com/'>here</a>.

For the purpose of this channel, we'll be showing you how to use AutoHotkey to automate tedious tasks inside of Premiere Pro.

As the saying goes, there are many ways to skin a cat, and AutoHotkey is but one of the tools available to automate your workflow and it has its own set of pro's and con's. The biggest advantage to using AutoHotkey is that it is EASY to use. When we say easy, we mean really easy. You don't need any programming knowledge in order to start learning how to use AutoHotkey. 

One of the drawbacks to using AutoHotkey is that it is OS specific, meaning you can only use it on Windows. Another drawback is that a lot of the advanced automations that we'll be writing will also be 'computer' specific - meaning that it will be a tedious task to replicate on another computer. The biggest drawback of all though, is that you have limited access to information inside of you host program. For example, you can't easily access the timecode, the in and point of clips, the amount of clips on a given timeline, etc, etc. That is where the power of CEP comes into play:

## CEP 

Although AutoHotkey is a lot more intuitive and easier to get started with if you don't have a programming background, a method of being dependent on the OS has it's drawbacks. 

As with everything in life, whatever tools works for you and solves your problem, go ahead and use that tool. In other words, if it is easier for you to use AutoHotkey to automate a task, then go for it. However, there might be some actions you aren't able to do with AutoHotkey, or perhaps you want to build a plug-in that can work across multiple computers and operating systems. That is where CEP comes in.

 The <a href='https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources'>Adobe Common Extensibility Platform (CEP)</a> allows us a way to program commands and actions directly into any Adobe Creative Cloud applications using a HTML5/JavaScript interface model. What this means is that with some HTML, CSS and JavaScript code you can interact with the Adobe applications and gain some super powers.
